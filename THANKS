Fundings and special thanks :
-----------------------------

Development of lcmm was part of the ANR-funded project MOBIDYQ, grant n° 2010 PRSP 006 01, and the IRESP-funded project MULTIPLE, grant n° AAP12CanBio16.

The authors warmly thank Thomas A. Gerds for his very useful R package Refresh which we used a million times to re-build and/or check lcmm. 
Refresh can be downloaded at: http://staff.pubhealth.ku.dk/~tag/research/Rontology/Refresh-snps.html

The authors also thank the R-core team for their constant help.
