\title{Longitudinal data on cognitive and physical aging in the elderly}
\format{
A data frame with 2250 observations over 500 subjects and 12
variables: \describe{ \item{ID}{subject identification number}
\item{MMSE}{score at the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a
psychometric test of global cognitive functioning (integer in range 0-30)}
\item{BVRT}{score at the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), a
psychometric test of spatial memory (integer in range 0-15)}
\item{IST}{score at the Isaacs Set Test (IST) truncated at 15
seconds, a test of verbal memory (integer in range 0-40)}
\item{HIER}{score of physical dependency (0=no dependency, 1=mild
dependency, 2=moderate dependency, 3=severe dependency)}
\item{CESD}{score of a short self-report scale CES-D designed to
measure depressive symptomatology in the general population (integer in
range 0-52)} \item{age}{age at the follow-up visit}
\item{dem}{indicator of positive diagnosis of dementia}
\item{agedem}{age at dementia diagnosis for \code{dem=1} and at last
contact for \code{dem=0}} \item{age_init}{age at entry in the
cohort} \item{CEP}{binary indicator of educational level
(\code{CEP=1} for subjects who graduated from primary school; \code{CEP=0}
otherwise)} \item{male}{binary indicator for gender (\code{male=1}
for men; \code{male=0} for women)} }
}
\description{
The dataset consists in a subsample of the Paquid prospective cohort study.
Repeated measures cognitive measures (MMSE, IST, BVRT psychometric tests),
physical dependency (HIER) and depression sympatomatology (CESD) were
collected over a maximum period of 20 years along with dementia information
(age at dementia diagnosis, dementia diagnosis information).
Time-independent socio-demographic information is also provided (CEP, male,
age_init).
