\title{
Multivariate Wald Test
}
\description{
This function provides multivariate and univariate Wald tests for combinations of parameters from \code{hlme}, \code{lcmm}, \code{multlcmm} or \code{Jointlcmm} models.
}
\usage{
WaldMult(Mod,pos=NULL,contrasts=NULL,name=NULL,value=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Mod}{
an object of class \code{hlme}, \code{lcmm}, \code{multlcmm} or \code{Jointlcmm}
}
 \item{pos}{a vector containing the indices in Mod\$best of the parameters to test}
 \item{contrasts}{a numeric vector of same length as pos.
 If NULL (the default), a simultaneous test of the appropriate parameters is realised.
 If contrasts is specified, the quantity to test is the dot product of pos and contrasts.}
 \item{name}{a character containing the name the user wants to give to the test. By default, the name's test is the null hypothesis.}
 \item{value}{the value(s) to test against. By default, test against 0.}
}

\value{
If contrasts is NULL, the function returns a matrix with 1 row and 2 columns containing the value of the Wald test's statistic and the associated p-value.

If contrasts is not NULL, the function returns a matrix with 1 row and 4 columns containing the value of the coefficient (dot product of pos and contrasts), his standard deviation, the value of the Wald test's statistic and the associated p-value.
