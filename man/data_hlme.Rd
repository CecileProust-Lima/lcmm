\title{Simulated dataset for hlme function}
\format{
A data frame with 326 observations on the following 9 variables.
\describe{ \item{ID}{subject identification number}
\item{Y}{longitudinal outcome} \item{Time}{time of
measurement} \item{X1}{binary covariate} \item{X2}{binary
covariate} \item{X3}{binary covariate} }
}
\description{
The data were simulated from a 3-latent class linear mixed model. Repeated
data for 100 subjects were simulated. The three latent classes are predicted
by X2 and X3. In each latent class, Y follows a linear mixed model including
intercept and time both with correlated random-effects and class-specific
fixed effects. In addition, X1 and X1*time have a common impact over classes
on the Y trajectory.
