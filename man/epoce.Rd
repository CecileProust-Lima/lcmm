\title{Estimators of the Expected Prognostic Observed Cross-Entropy (EPOCE) for
evaluating predictive accuracy of joint latent class models estimated using
\code{Jointlcmm}}
\usage{
epoce(
  model,
  pred.times,
  var.time,
  fun.time = identity,
  newdata = NULL,
  subset = NULL,
  na.action = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object inheriting from class \code{Jointlcmm}}

\item{pred.times}{Vector of times of prediction, from which predictive
accuracy is evaluated (only subjects still at risk at the time of prediction
are included in the computation, and only information before the time of
prediction is considered.}

\item{var.time}{Name of the variable indicating time in the dataset}

\item{fun.time}{an optional function. This is only required if the time
scales in the longitudinal part of the model and the survival part are
different. In that case, \code{fun.time} is the function that translates the
times from the longitudinal part into the time scale of the survival part.
The default is the identity function which means that the two time scales
are the same.}

\item{newdata}{optional. When missing, the data used for estimating the
\code{Jointlcmm} object are used, and CVPOL and MPOL are computed (internal
validation). When newdata is specified, only MPOL is computed on this
newdataset (external validation).}

\item{subset}{a specification of the rows to be used: defaults to all rows.
This can be any valid indexing vector for the rows of data or if that is not
supplied, a data frame made up of the variable used in formula.}

\item{na.action}{Integer indicating how NAs are managed. The default is 1
for 'na.omit'. The alternative is 2 for 'na.fail'. Other options such as
'na.pass' or 'na.exclude' are not implemented in the current version.}
}
\value{
\item{call.Jointlcmm}{the \code{Jointlcmm} call}
\item{call.epoce}{the matched call} \item{EPOCE}{Dataframe containing, for
each prediction time s, the number of subjects still at risk at s (and with
at least one measure before s), the number of events after time s, the MPOL,
and the CVPOL when computation is done on the dataset used for
\code{Jointlcmm} estimation} \item{IndivContrib}{Individual contributions to
the prognostic observed log-likelihood at each time of prediction. Used for
computing tracking intervals of EPOCE differences between models.}
\item{new.data}{a boolean for internal use only, which is FALSE if
computation is done on the same data as for \code{Jointlcmm} estimation, and
TRUE otherwise.}
}
\description{
This function computes estimators of the Expected Prognostic Observed
Cross-Entropy (EPOCE) for evaluating the predictive accuracy of joint latent
class models estimated using \code{Jointlcmm}. On the same data as used for
estimation of the \code{Jointlcmm} object, this function computes both the
Mean Prognostic Observed Log-Likelihood (MPOL) and the Cross-Validated
Observed Log-Likelihood (CVPOL), two estimators of EPOCE. The latter
corrects the MPOL estimate for over-optimism by approximated
cross-validation. On external data, this function only computes the Mean
Prognostic Observed Log-Likelihood (MPOL).
}
\details{
This function does not apply for the moment with multiple causes of event
(competing risks).

EPOCE assesses the prognostic information of a joint latent class model. It
relies on information theory.

MPOL computed at time s equals minus the mean individual contribution to the
conditional log-likelihood of the time to event given the longitudinal data
up to the time of prediction s and given the subject is still at risk of
event in s.

CVPOL computed at time s equals MPOL at time s plus a penalty term that
corrects for over-optimism when computing predictive accuracy measures on
the same dataset as used for estimation. This penalty term is computed from
the inverse of the Hessian of the joint log-likelihood and the product of
the gradients of the contributions to respectively the joint log-likelihood
and the conditional log-likelihood.

The theory of EPOCE and its estimators MPOL and CVPOL is given in Commenges
et al. (2012), and further detailed and illustrated for joint models in
Proust-Lima et al. (2013).
