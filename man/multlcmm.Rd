\arguments{
\item{fixed}{a two-sided linear formula object for specifying the
fixed-effects in the linear mixed model at the latent process level. The
response outcomes are separated by \code{+} on the left of \code{~} and the
covariates are separated by \code{+} on the right of the \code{~}. For
identifiability purposes, the intercept specified by default should not be
removed by a \code{-1}. Variables on which a contrast above the different
outcomes should also be estimated are included with \code{contrast()}.}

\item{mixture}{a one-sided formula object for the class-specific fixed
effects in the latent process mixed model (to specify only for a number of
latent classes greater than 1). Among the list of covariates included in
\code{fixed}, the covariates with class-specific regression parameters are
entered in \code{mixture} separated by \code{+}. By default, an intercept is
included. If no intercept, \code{-1} should be the first term included.}

\item{random}{an optional one-sided formula for the random-effects in the
latent process mixed model. At least one random effect should be included
for identifiability purposes. Covariates with a random-effect are separated
by \code{+}. By default, an intercept is included. If no intercept,
\code{-1} should be the first term included.}

\item{subject}{name of the covariate representing the grouping structure.}

\item{classmb}{an optional one-sided formula describing the covariates in
the class-membership multinomial logistic model. Covariates included are
separated by \code{+}. No intercept should be included in this formula.}

\item{ng}{number of latent classes considered. If \code{ng=1} no
\code{mixture} nor \code{classmb} should be specified. If \code{ng>1},
\code{mixture} is required.}

\item{idiag}{optional logical for the variance-covariance structure of the
random-effects. If \code{FALSE}, a non structured matrix of
variance-covariance is considered (by default). If \code{TRUE} a diagonal
matrix of variance-covariance is considered.}

\item{nwg}{optional logical of class-specific variance-covariance of the
random-effects. If \code{FALSE} the variance-covariance matrix is common
over latent classes (by default). If \code{TRUE} a class-specific
proportional parameter multiplies the variance-covariance matrix in each
class (the proportional parameter in the last latent class equals 1 to
ensure identifiability).}

\item{randomY}{optional logical for including an outcome-specific random
intercept. If \code{FALSE} no outcome-specific random intercept is added
(default). If \code{TRUE} independent outcome-specific random intercepts
with parameterized variance are included.}

\item{link}{optional vector of families of parameterized link functions to
estimate (one by outcome). Option "linear" (by default) specifies a linear
link function. Other possibilities include "beta" for estimating a link
function from the family of Beta cumulative distribution functions and
"Splines" for approximating the link function by I-splines. For this latter
case, the number of nodes and the nodes location should be also specified.
The number of nodes is first entered followed by \code{-}, then the location
is specified with "equi", "quant" or "manual" for respectively equidistant
nodes, nodes at quantiles of the marker distribution or interior nodes
entered manually in argument \code{intnodes}. It is followed by \code{-} and
finally "splines" is indicated.  For example, "7-equi-splines" means
I-splines with 7 equidistant nodes, "6-quant-splines" means I-splines with 6
nodes located at the quantiles of the marker distribution and
"9-manual-splines" means I-splines with 9 nodes, the vector of 7 interior
nodes being entered in the argument \code{intnodes}.}

\item{intnodes}{optional vector of interior nodes. This argument is only
required for a I-splines link function with nodes entered manually.}

\item{epsY}{optional definite positive real used to rescale the marker in
(0,1) when the beta link function is used. By default, epsY=0.5.}

\item{cor}{optional indicator for inclusion of an autocorrelated Gaussian
process in the latent process linear (latent process) mixed model. Option
"BM" indicates a brownian motion with parameterized variance. Option "AR"
specifies an autoregressive process of order 1 with parameterized variance
and correlation intensity. Each option should be followed by the time
variable in brackets as \code{cor=BM(time)}. By default, no autocorrelated
Gaussian process is added.}

\item{data}{data frame containing the variables named in \code{fixed},
\code{mixture}, \code{random}, \code{classmb} and \code{subject}.}

\item{B}{optional specification for the initial values for the parameters.
Three options are allowed: (1) a vector of initial values is entered (the
order in which the parameters are included is detailed in \code{details}
section).  (2) nothing is specified. A preliminary analysis involving the
estimation of a standard linear mixed model is performed to choose initial
values.  (3) when ng>1, a multlcmm object is entered. It should correspond
to the exact same structure of model but with ng=1. The program will
automatically generate initial values from this model. This specification
avoids the preliminary analysis indicated in (2) Note that due to possible
local maxima, the \code{B} vector should be specified and several different
starting points should be tried.}

\item{convB}{optional threshold for the convergence criterion based on the
parameter stability. By default, convB=0.0001.}

\item{convL}{optional threshold for the convergence criterion based on the
log-likelihood stability. By default, convL=0.0001.}

\item{convG}{optional threshold for the convergence criterion based on the
derivatives. By default, convG=0.0001.}

\item{maxiter}{optional maximum number of iterations for the Marquardt
iterative algorithm. By default, maxiter=100.}

\item{nsim}{number of points used to plot the estimated link functions. By
default, nsim=100.}

\item{prior}{name of the covariate containing the prior on the latent class
membership. The covariate should be an integer with values in 0,1,...,ng.
When there is no prior, the value should be 0. When there is a prior for the
subject, the value should be the number of the latent class (in 1,...,ng).}

\item{range}{optional vector indicating the range of the outcomes (that is
the minimum and maximum). By default, the range is defined according to the
minimum and maximum observed values of the outcome. The option should be
used only for Beta and Splines transformations.}

\item{subset}{optional vector giving the subset of observations in
\code{data} to use. By default, all lines.}

\item{na.action}{Integer indicating how NAs are managed. The default is 1
for 'na.omit'. The alternative is 2 for 'na.fail'. Other options such as
'na.pass' or 'na.exclude' are not implemented in the current version.}

\item{posfix}{Optional vector giving the indices in vector B of the
parameters that should not be estimated. Default to NULL, all parameters are
estimated.}

\item{partialH}{optional logical for Beta or Splines link functions only.
Indicates whether the parameters of the link functions can be dropped from
the Hessian matrix to define convergence criteria.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if information about computation should be
reported. Default to TRUE.}

\item{returndata}{logical indicating if data used for computation should be
returned. Default to FALSE, data are not returned.}

\description{
This function constitutes a multivariate extension of function \code{lcmm}.
It fits multivariate mixed models and multivariate latent class mixed models
for multivariate longitudinal outcomes of different types. It handles
continuous longitudinal outcomes (Gaussian or non-Gaussian, curvilinear) as
well as bounded quantitative and discrete longitudinal outcomes. Next
version will also handle ordinal outcomes.  The model assumes that all the
outcomes measure the same underlying latent process defined as their common
factor, and each outcome is related to this latent common factor by a
specific parameterized link function.  At the latent process level, the
model estimates a standard linear mixed model or a latent class linear mixed
model when heterogeneity in the population is investigated (in the same way
as in function \code{hlme}). Parameters of the nonlinear link functions and
of the latent process mixed model are estimated simultaneously using a
maximum likelihood method.
}
\details{
A. THE PARAMETERIZED LINK FUNCTIONS

\code{multlcmm} function estimates multivariate latent class mixed models
for different types of outcomes by assuming a parameterized link function
for linking each outcome Y_k(t) with the underlying latent common factor
L(t) they measure. To fix the latent process dimension, we chose to
constrain at the latent process level the (first) intercept of the latent
class mixed model at 0 and the standard error of the first random effect at
1.

1. With the "linear" link function, 2 parameters are required for the
following transformation (Y(t) - b1)/b2

2. With the "beta" link function, 4 parameters are required for the
following transformation: [ h(Y(t)',b1,b2) - b3]/b4 where h is the Beta CDF
with canonical parameters c1 and c2 that can be derived from b1 and b2 as
c1=exp(b1)/[exp(b2)*(1+exp(b1))] and c2=1/[exp(b2)*(1+exp(b1))], and Y(t)'
is the rescaled outcome i.e. Y(t)'= [ Y(t) - min(Y(t)) + epsY ] / [
max(Y(t)) - min(Y(t)) +2*epsY ].

3. With the "splines" link function, n+2 parameters are required for the
following transformation b_1 + b_2*I_1(Y(t)) + ... + b_{n+2} I_{n+1}(Y(t)),
where I_1,...,I_{n+1} is the basis of quadratic I-splines. To constraint the
parameters to be positive, except for b_1, the program estimates b_k^* (for
k=2,...,n+2) so that b_k=(b_k^*)^2. This parameterization may lead in some
cases to problems of convergence that we are currently addressing.

Details of these parameterized link functions can be found in the papers:
Proust-Lima et al. (Biometrics 2006) and Proust-Lima et al. (BJMSP 2013).

B. THE VECTOR OF PARAMETERS B

The parameters in the vector of initial values \code{B} or in the vector of
maximum likelihood estimates \code{best} are included in the following
order: (1) ng-1 parameters are required for intercepts in the latent class
membership model, and if covariates are included in \code{classmb}, ng-1
paramaters should be entered for each one; (2) for all covariates in
\code{fixed}, one parameter is required if the covariate is not in
\code{mixture}, ng paramaters are required if the covariate is also in
\code{mixture}; When ng=1, the intercept is not estimated and no parameter
should be specified in \code{B}. When ng>1, the first intercept is not
estimated and only ng-1 parameters should be specified in \code{B}; (3) for
all covariates included with \code{contrast()} in \code{fixed}, one
supplementary parameter per outcome is required excepted for the last
outcome for which the parameter is not estimated but deduced from the
others; (4) if \code{idiag=TRUE}, the variance of each random-effect
specified in \code{random} is required excepted the first one (usually the
intercept) which is constrained to 1. (5) if \code{idiag=FALSE}, the
inferior triangular variance-covariance matrix of all the random-effects is
required excepted the first variance (usually the intercept) which is
constrained to 1. (5) only if \code{nwg=TRUE} and \code{ng}>1, ng-1
parameters for class-specific proportional coefficients for the variance
covariance matrix of the random-effects; (6) if \code{cor} is specified, the
standard error of the Brownian motion or the standard error and the
correlation parameter of the autoregressive process; (7) the standard error
of the outcome-specific Gaussian errors (one per outcome); (8) if
\code{randomY=TRUE}, the standard error of the outcome-specific random
intercept (one per outcome); (9) the parameters of each parameterized link
function: 2 for "linear", 4 for "beta", n+2 for "splines" with n nodes.

C. CAUTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF THE PROGRAM

Some caution should be made when using the program. Convergence criteria are
very strict as they are based on the derivatives of the log-likelihood in
addition to the parameter and log-likelihood stability. In some cases, the
program may not converge and reach the maximum number of iterations fixed at
100. In this case, the user should check that parameter estimates at the
last iteration are not on the boundaries of the parameter space.

If the parameters are on the boundaries of the parameter space, the
identifiability of the model is critical. This may happen especially with
splines parameters that may be too close to 0 (lower boundary) or classmb
parameters that are too high or low (perfect classification). When
identifiability of some parameters is suspected, the program can be run
again from the former estimates by fixing the suspected parameters to their
value with option posfix. This usually solves the problem. An alternative is
to remove the parameters of the Beta of Splines link function from the
inverse of the Hessian with option partialH.

If not, the program should be run again with other initial values, with a
higher maximum number of iterations or less strict convergence tolerances.

Specifically when investigating heterogeneity (that is with ng>1): (1) As
the log-likelihood of a latent class model can have multiple maxima, a
careful choice of the initial values is crucial for ensuring convergence
toward the global maximum. The program can be run without entering the
vector of initial values (see point 2). However, we recommend to
systematically enter initial values in \code{B} and try different sets of
initial values. (2) The automatic choice of initial values we provide
requires the estimation of a preliminary linear mixed model. The user should
be aware that first, this preliminary analysis can take time for large
datatsets and second, that the generated initial values can be very not
likely and even may converge slowly to a local maximum. This is the reason
why several alternatives exist. The vector of initial values can be directly
specified in \code{B} the initial values can be generated (automatically or
randomly) from a model with \code{ng=}. Finally, function \code{gridsearch}
performs an automatic grid search.
