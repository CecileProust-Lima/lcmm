\arguments{
\item{fixed}{two-sided linear formula object for the fixed-effects in the
linear mixed model. The response outcome is on the left of \code{~} and the
covariates are separated by \code{+} on the right of \code{~}.  By default,
an intercept is included. If no intercept, \code{-1} should be the first
term included on the right of \code{~}.}

\item{mixture}{one-sided formula object for the class-specific fixed effects
in the linear mixed model (to specify only for a number of latent classes
greater than 1).  Among the list of covariates included in \code{fixed}, the
covariates with class-specific regression parameters are entered in
\code{mixture} separated by \code{+}.  By default, an intercept is included.
If no intercept, \code{-1} should be the first term included.}

\item{random}{optional one-sided formula for the random-effects in the
linear mixed model. Covariates with a random-effect are separated by
\code{+}.  By default, an intercept is included. If no intercept, \code{-1}
should be the first term included.}

\item{subject}{name of the covariate representing the grouping structure
specified with ''.}

\item{classmb}{optional one-sided formula describing the covariates in the
class-membership multinomial logistic model. Covariates included are
separated by \code{+}.  No intercept should be included in this formula.}

\item{ng}{optional number of latent classes considered. If \code{ng=1} (by
default) no \code{mixture} nor \code{classmb} should be specified. If
\code{ng>1}, \code{mixture} is required.}

\item{idiag}{optional logical for the structure of the variance-covariance
matrix of the random-effects. If \code{FALSE}, a non structured matrix of
variance-covariance is considered (by default).  If \code{TRUE} a diagonal
matrix of variance-covariance is considered.}

\item{nwg}{optional logical indicating if the variance-covariance of the
random-effects is class-specific. If \code{FALSE} the variance-covariance
matrix is common over latent classes (by default). If \code{TRUE} a
class-specific proportional parameter multiplies the variance-covariance
matrix in each class (the proportional parameter in the last latent class
equals 1 to ensure identifiability).}

\item{cor}{optional brownian motion or autoregressive process modeling the
correlation between the observations.  "BM" or "AR" should be specified,
followed by the time variable between brackets. By default, no correlation
is added.}

\item{data}{optional data frame containing the variables named in
\code{fixed}, \code{mixture}, \code{random}, \code{classmb} and
\code{subject}.}

\item{B}{optional specification for the initial values for the parameters.
Three options are allowed: (1) a vector of initial values is entered (the
order in which the parameters are included is detailed in \code{details}
section).  (2) nothing is specified. A preliminary analysis involving the
estimation of a standard linear mixed model is performed to choose initial
values.  (3) when ng>1, a hlme object is entered. It should correspond to
the exact same structure of model but with ng=1. The program will
automatically generate initial values from this model. This specification
avoids the preliminary analysis indicated in (2). Note that due to possible
local maxima, the \code{B} vector should be specified and several different
starting points should be tried.}

\item{convB}{optional threshold for the convergence criterion based on the
parameter stability. By default, convB=0.0001.}

\item{convL}{optional threshold for the convergence criterion based on the
log-likelihood stability. By default, convL=0.0001.}

\item{convG}{optional threshold for the convergence criterion based on the
derivatives. By default, convG=0.0001.}

\item{prior}{optional name of a covariate containing a prior information
about the latent class membership. The covariate should be an integer with
values in 0,1,...,ng. Value 0 indicates no prior for the subject while a
value in 1,...,ng indicates that the subject belongs to the corresponding
latent class.}

\item{maxiter}{optional maximum number of iterations for the Marquardt
iterative algorithm. By default, maxiter=500.}

\item{subset}{a specification of the rows to be used: defaults to all rows.
This can be any valid indexing vector for the rows of data or if that is not
supplied, a data frame made up of the variable used in formula.}

\item{na.action}{Integer indicating how NAs are managed. The default is 1
for 'na.omit'. The alternative is 2 for 'na.fail'. Other options such as
'na.pass' or 'na.exclude' are not implemented in the current version.}

\item{posfix}{Optional vector specifying the indices in vector B of the
parameters that should not be estimated. Default to NULL, all parameters are
estimated.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if information about computation should be
reported. Default to TRUE.}

\item{returndata}{logical indicating if data used for computation should be
returned. Default to FALSE, data are not returned.}

\description{
This function fits linear mixed models and latent class linear mixed models
(LCLMM) also known as growth mixture models or heterogeneous linear mixed
models.  The LCLMM consists in assuming that the population is divided in a
finite number of latent classes. Each latent class is characterised by a
specific trajectory modelled by a class-specific linear mixed model.  Both
the latent class membership and the trajectory can be explained according to
covariates.  This function is limited to a mixture of Gaussian outcomes. For
other types of outcomes, please see function \code{lcmm}. For multivariate
longitudinal outcomes, please see \code{multlcmm}.

A. THE VECTOR OF PARAMETERS B

The parameters in the vector of initial values \code{B} or equivalently in
the vector of maximum likelihood estimates \code{best} are included in the
following order:

(1) ng-1 parameters are required for intercepts in the latent class
membership model, and when covariates are included in \code{classmb}, ng-1
paramaters should be entered for each covariate;

(2) for all covariates in \code{fixed}, one parameter is required if the
covariate is not in \code{mixture}, ng paramaters are required if the
covariate is also in \code{mixture};

(3) the variance of each random-effect specified in \code{random} (including
the intercept) when \code{idiag=TRUE}, or the inferior triangular
variance-covariance matrix of all the random-effects when
\code{idiag=FALSE};

(4) only when \code{nwg=TRUE}, ng-1 parameters are required for the ng-1
class-specific proportional coefficients in the variance covariance matrix
of the random-effects;

(5) when \code{cor} is specified, 1 parameter corresponding to the variance
of the Brownian motion should be entered with \code{cor=BM} and 2 parameters
corresponding to the correlation and the variance parameters of the
autoregressive process should be entered

(6) the standard error of the residual error.

B. CAUTIONS

Some caution should be made when using the program:

(1) As the log-likelihood of a latent class model can have multiple maxima,
a careful choice of the initial values is crucial for ensuring convergence
toward the global maximum.  The program can be run without entering the
vector of initial values (see point 2).  However, we recommend to
systematically enter initial values in \code{B} and try different sets of
initial values.

(2) The automatic choice of initial values we provide requires the
estimation of a preliminary linear mixed model. The user should be aware
that first, this preliminary analysis can take time for large datatsets and
second, that the generated initial values can be very not likely and even
may converge slowly to a local maximum.  This is the reason why several
alternatives exist. The vector of initial values can be directly specified
in \code{B} the initial values can be generated (automatically or randomly)
from a model with \code{ng=}. Finally, function \code{gridsearch} performs
an automatic grid search.

(3) Convergence criteria are very strict as they are based on the
derivatives of the log-likelihood in addition to the parameter stability and
log-likelihood stability.  In some cases, the program may not converge and
reach the maximum number of iterations fixed at 100.  In this case, the user
should check that parameter estimates at the last iteration are not on the
boundaries of the parameter space.  If the parameters are on the boundaries
of the parameter space, the identifiability of the model is critical. This
may happen especially with splines parameters that may be too close to 0
(lower boundary) or classmb parameters that are too high or low (perfect
classification). When identifiability of some parameters is suspected, the
program can be run again from the former estimates by fixing the suspected
parameters to their value with option posfix. This usually solves the
problem. An alternative is to remove the parameters of the Beta of Splines
link function from the inverse of the Hessian with option partialH.  If not,
the program should be run again with other initial values, with a higher
maximum number of iterations or less strict convergence tolerances.

##### Example of a latent class model estimated for a varying number
# of latent classes: 
# The model includes a subject- (ID) and class-specific linear 
# trend (intercept and Time in fixed, random and mixture components)
# and a common effect of X1 and its interaction with time over classes 
# (in fixed). 
# The variance of the random intercept and slope are assumed to be equal 
# over classes (nwg=F).
# The covariate X3 predicts the class membership (in classmb).
#
# !CAUTION: initialization of mixed models with latent classes is 
# of most importance because of the problem of multimodality of the likelihood.
# Calls m2a-m2d illustrate the different implementations for the 
# initial values.
